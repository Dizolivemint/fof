Joomla changes the HTML output of fields all the time *for no reason at all*. You might be excused to think that we're stupid because we're testing against the HTML output of form fields as strings since whitespace can change. But that's not the case here. Joomla! changes the DOM, add/removes attributes and basically does whatever every random contributor pushes _as long as they don't seem to break core templates_. This means that there is no guarantee what the DOM generated for a particular field with the exact same input data will look over time and there's no documentation of the changes.  
 
 This makes it impossible for us to unit test form fields. Worse, we're stuck with perpetually broken tests. As such we never know if we really broke FOF or if it's just the bloody form field tests broken again because some random fool changed the HTML output YET AGAIN in Joomla. Therefore we are trashing those tests and excluding the entire form package from code coverage. Besides, anything that breaks in the form package has consistently been either something Joomla broke or something we had never added in FOF.
